# XOR Build system

```
git clone https://github.com/jhessane/xor-build.git
cd xor-build
gmake components
gmake recovery
```
Et voil√†! One freshly baked ISO (after some waiting) of the most lightweight illumos distribution (mostly because there's nothing and nothing really works) under the ```output/``` directory. Tested on OmniOS r151054.
